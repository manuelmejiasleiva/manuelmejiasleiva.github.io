**Introduction to data analysis with R**

The aim of this course is to familiarise students with the operation of R, RStudio and the fundamentals of data analysis and manipulation. Upon completion, students will be prepared to work with R for both quantitative methods courses and their own analyses. 

During all sessions, they will work with survey data that address issues related to educational and social inequalities. This will allow students to apply the acquired knowledge to real and relevant situations, which will help them to better understand the complexity of these issues and to develop practical skills in data handling.
