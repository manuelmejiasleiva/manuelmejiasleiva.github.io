I am a sociologist from the [Pablo de Olavide University](https://www.upo.es/intl/?lang=en) and I have a PhD in Transdisciplinary Research in Education from the [University of Valladolid](https://universityofvalladolid.uva.es/). I also have a Master's degree in Political and Electoral Analysis from the [University Carlos III of Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/Inicio) and a Master's degree in Data Science from the Universidad Antonio de Nebrija.

My research interests focus on families, educational inequality and the intergenerational transmission of (dis)advantages. I have also worked on issues such as child poverty, youth emancipation and gender inequalities in childhood and adolescence. In my research I use quantitative methods and I am currently deepening the use of causal inference designs.

My work has been published in journals such as [Revista Española de Investigaciones Sociológicas](https://reis.cis.es/index.php/reis), [Genus](https://genus.springeropen.com/) and [International Journal of Sociology of Education](https://hipatiapress.com/hpjournals/index.php/rise/), among others. You can consult my publications and profile in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=bNFuD_YAAAAJ&hl=es), where most of my research is available in open access.
